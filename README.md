# Codeucation
## Description
Codeucation is a digital platform that supports secondary school teachers in teaching Python programming. It provides a learning environment where students complete coding exercises, while teachers can track progress and manage classes without needing advanced programming skills. Teachers can also follow the courses themselves, enabling them to fully master the material before teaching it. The platform integrates an automatic code testing system, offering instant feedback. With its user-friendly interface and practical tools, Codeucation strengthens both teaching and learning in computer science education.

def fibonacci(n):
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return result 
```

#### Fibonacci recursive
```
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

def fibonacci(n):
    return [fib(i) for i in range(n)]
```

### Priemgetallen
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:

    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
